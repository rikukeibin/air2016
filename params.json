  "name": "The 1st International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Robotics 2016 (AIR2016)",
  "tagline": "December 13-16, 2016  Wuhan, China",
  "body": "The integration of artificial intelligence and robotic technologies has become a topic of increasing interest for both researchers and developers from academic fields and industries worldwide. It is foreseeable that artificial intelligence will be the main approach of the next generation of robotic research. The explosive number of artificial intelligence algorithms and increasing computational power of computers has significantly extended the number of potential applications for robotic technologies. It has also brought new challenges to the artificial intelligence community. The aim of this workshop is to provide a platform to share up-to-date scientific achievements in this field.\r\n**Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:**\r\n\r\n**Multimedia:**\r\n* Audio Multimedia Learning\r\n* Cross Multimedia Learning\r\n* Computational Imaging\r\n* Cloud Multimedia Processing for Robotics\r\n* Deep Learning for Robot Vision\r\n* HPC GPU for Deep Learning\r\n* Multimedia for Robot Manipulation\r\n* Multimedia for Robot Control\r\n* Multimedia for Robot Navigation\r\n* Multimedia Fusion for Robotics\r\n* Multimedia Communications for Robots\r\n* Multimedia Compression for Robots\r\n* Object Retrieval\r\n* Theoretical Foundations of Multimedia Learning\r\n* User Experience for Big Multimedia Systems\r\n* Wireless Multimedia Robots\r\n\r\n**Computer Vision:**\r\n* Theoretical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision\r\n* 3D Scene Reconstruction\r\n* RGB-D Vision\r\n* Pattern Recognition and Machine Vision\r\n* Computational Imaging\r\n* Object Tracking\r\n* Deep Learning for Computer Vision\r\n* Big Data Analysis for Computer Vision\r\n* Computer Vision for Ocean Observing\r\n* Robot Calibration\r\n* Vision-based Robotic Manipulation\r\n\r\n**Control:**\r\n* System Modeling and Simulation, Dynamics and Control\r\n* Intelligent and Learning Control\r\n* Robotics and Mechatronics\r\n* Robust and Nonlinear Control\r\n* Biomedical Systems and Control\r\n\r\nPapers must be unpublished and must not be submitted for publication elsewhere. All papers will be reviewed by Program Committee members and other experts active in the field to ensure high quality and relevance to the conference. Submissions should include author information, abstract, 5-10 keywords, and be in PDF format. Each submission must not exceed 10 pages in the IEEE 8.5\" x 11\" two-column format with 10 point font, including tables, figures and references. Template formatting is located at [http://grid.hust.edu.cn/icpads2016/Submissions.html](http://grid.hust.edu.cn/icpads2016/Submissions.html). The final version will be limited to 8 pages in IEEE proceeding format for conference papers. Up to 2 extra pages may be purchased.\r\n\r\nEach submission should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the submission be accepted, at least one of the authors must register the paper and attend the conference to present the work in order for the accepted paper to be included into the IEEE digital library.
